# CONNECTING THE BOARD
The board has a NFC antenna. before anything else, this antenna must be placed in its dedicated place. Then, the board must be connected to the computer via a micro USB  cable.
There exist two switches, which must be appropraitely set for the board to start working.the first is at the bottommost of the board right below where the cable gets connected.
This switch has two states: ON,OFF. this is the main switch to turn the whole board on or off.
Second, there is a three state switch: Li-po,VDD,USB. this switch determines the board source of power. for having the board works properly while connected to the computer, this switch must be on VDD.
after these settings LED5 must become turned on. If the board has the factory program compiled to it, one sees that LED1 starts blinking and whenever each of the 4 buttons at the right bottommost of the board are pressed, the corresponding LED gets turned on.
